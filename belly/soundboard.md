# Soundboard

## Background

**The power of suggestion is positively enormous, especially when it comes to the soundboard.**

There seems to be quite a bit of mythology regarding the soundboard, and the prevailing beliefs about the soundboard survive only by the financial success of those who continue to champion those beliefs, leading to a kind of an echo-chamber effect. These prevailing beliefs include:

1. The soundboard must be made of wood.
   "If it's not wood, it can't be good."
   
   Further, the wood must be tonewood: old-growth Sitka spruce seems to be the commonly used wood, owing to its density. One myth that was thankfully put to rest was that the types of cells in spruce resonated in a particular way (_Pianos Inside and Out_, Mario Igrec, p?? -- too lazy to get up and find the reference right now).
   
   Lesser known manufacturers in history have made one- or two-off pianos with glass/metal/whatnot soundboards. Surviving remarks about these pianos imply that they sounded like pianos, or at least that the unorthodox soundboard material didn't impart any considerable negative qualities to the sound.
   
   The Phoenix company has made some pianos with a carbon fiber soundboard, vis. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBvrQlZYS-o)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBvrQlZYS-o]. These pianos are met with great a combination of great skepticism, but restrained acknowledgement that the pianos sound a bit better than expected. Two remarks:
     - Most commonly reported is that the pianos sound "metallic" or "bright".
     - No blind, AB, or ABX tests have been done against these pianos.

2. The soundboard must be crowned.
   This demonstration shows the source of what is likely a misconception: (https://youtu.be/hymAsUn737I?t=126)[https://youtu.be/hymAsUn737I?t=126]
   
   Some counterarguments by Ronald Nossamen and Del Fandrich: (my.ptg.org)[http://my.ptg.org/communities/community-home/digestviewer/viewthread?GroupId=1171&MID=321088&tab=digestviewer&CommunityKey=e2c6a925-0387-4a43-8920-02dd4c8d591a#bm6]
   
   It seems like we have correlation but not causation, or something similar: crown is found in soundboards that produce good sound, and the loss of crown is associated with poor sound or loss of sound, ergo crown is responsible for the good sound.
   
   What might be happening is that crown (combined with string downbearing) imparts stiffness to the soundboard mechanism, and is what causes the resonance we're after.

But luckily, there's some actual science being done:

1. Del Fandrich ((Piano Buyer)[http://www.pianobuyer.com/Articles/Detail/ArticleId/215/THE-BENEFITS-OF-LAMINATED-SOUNDBOARDS]) finds that laminated soundboards, in a particular configuration, perform well and offer resistance to warping and other changes.
1. Others (Squicciarini, et al; Mokdad; Egehave, et al) have shown that certain sections of the soundboard will resonate at different frequencies, and have gone so far as to suggest a numerical model for the soundboard. *This assumes certain conventions; a revolutionary soundboard would have to be remodeled, however certain fundamental principles might transfer to a new approach to soundboard construction.*
1. Fandrich and Overs (citations needed), independently, have experimented with floating sections of the soundboard near the bass strings to improve the bass response, especially in smaller pianos.
   Fandrich especially feels that this approach to bass-section improvement is much more effective than another common approach, which is to add a cantilever to the bass bridge.


Lastly, Del acknowledges the great power of suggestion! (Pianoworld Forums.)[http://forum.pianoworld.com/ubbthreads.php/topics/2465772/re-laminated-soundboards.html#Post2465772]
