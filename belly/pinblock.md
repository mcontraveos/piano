# Pinblock

The pinblock secures all the tuning pins. In a high-tension scale instrument, it shouldbe able to withstant a sum of over 20 tons of string tension. Traditionally, this has been made out of solid hard rock maple, but wooden lamination seems to be the most commonly seen construction nowadays. 

Laminations are cross-grain, which seemingly allow for better grip of the pin and for better behavior when reacting to changes in the humidity or temperature [<https://www.chuppspianos.com/services/grand-piano-parts/pin-block/>, and others].

# Ideas for approach

Bill Bremmer offers this as an opportunity to exploit the natural strengths of bamboo:
> The hard rock maple pinblock is traditional but in more recent years, multi-laminate wood materials under high pressure have served to transform ordinary wood into a far more dense material. This is what can be done with bamboo fibers! The question that remains, however is how well bamboo could hold up to tuning pins. I speculate that it could be as resilient as any wood product, if not better.
