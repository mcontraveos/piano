# Steingräber & Söhne

## Bridges
* Linear Bass bridge, even on 5'7" grand. A0 bridge pin a good 6" from rim of piano. 
* Models A, B, and C: *two* laminations -- top portion, out of which notches are cut; and bottom portion, which connects to the soundboard.
  The entire bridge is made of two pieces. Higher-end models, like the D and E, use laminate bridges, I believe.

## Other notes
* Lid made of aluminum core. We're going to do this.
* Engage Kluge and Otto Heuss for keyboards -- Jeff from GPH claims this is because as a small company, they can't afford to have their only keyboard supplier dry up.
* Renner action. Wuerzen felt, fit to S&S molds, which are diamond-shaped.
* Keyframe includes soundboard material.
* Felt punchings surround hitch pins on all models and strings.
* Bass response on A-170 5'7" grand was surprisingly good -- string at a steep angle, stopping well short of the rim and going over a generous portion of the center of the soundboard. Huge area of the left-hand side of the A-170's soundboard is uncovered.
