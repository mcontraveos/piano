# Rims

# Background

The most common rim construction method is veneer adhesion and deformation, nearly always by means of a rim press. There are other ways of bending wood, using techniques common to guitar-making.

Hard-rock maple is the industry standard, with some manufacturers using other woods for the innermost layer of veneer, ostensibly for appearance's sake. Mahogany -- or in some cases, "Philippine Mahogany", or luan -- is often used for this layer due to its hardness. Makers like Estonia and Kawai for Boston use other, flashier woods to appease people who misuse pianos as furniture only.

Rim thickness varies by manufacturer, but these all seem to follow the trend of overengineering. Mason & Hamlin's rims are a combined 3.375", and likely weigh about 15,000 tons alone. As far as I know, these rims have to support the heavy iron plates, which:
  * are heavy to support the massive tension the strings are under, which:
    * is high to produce tons of sound, which:
      * needs to be loud enough to reach the last person in the "concert hall", which
        * in 9/10 piano sales scenarios, is actually someone's 15 x 15 living room.

# Ideas

In the context of a much, much lower tension instrument, is there any way the rims can be turned from resonators to transducers? Would that even be a desirable quality?

Putting that aside, it seems this would be a great area to use bamboo -- lightweight, dense and strong material.
