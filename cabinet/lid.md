# Lid

## Background

Lids are conventionally the same finish as the rest of the piano, but sometimes will feature a veneer of a different finish, for appearance's sake. Lids are also usually made of some dense material, like MDF. As far as I can tell, the first two purposes of the lid are to protect the belly of the piano when not in use, and to reflect the sound from the belly towards the audience.

This resource lists the absorption and sound reduction coefficients for many building materials across several frequency bands:

It would seem that a high-density wood product, like MDF, is a compromise: wood is not nearly the highest-reflective building material for the lid, but God forbid that a piano's case be built out of anything but wood. It would seem that MDF is chosen over solid wood because of its density and resistance to warping.

While open, the lid is only connected to the piano by the hinges, which, I'd have to think, wouldn't carry too much sound from the piano at all to the lid.

## Alternatives

### Aluminum comb core
SteingrÃ¤ber said "to hell with this" and basically wrapped aluminum honeycomb in some veneer and called it a day:

* I can't see how this does a "better job" (Hugh Sung's words) of reflecting the sound. If anything, I think it could only do as good a job of a solid/composite lid at best, but certainly not better, on account of the honeycomb's significantly lower density.
* How will the honeycomb lid stand up to warping?
* Comb itself should be layered between two sheets of aluminum, which is fairly common when buying wholesale aluminum core.

### Bamboo
Bamboo in piano construction deserves its own section, but bears making a few remarks here. If the aluminum comb core idea proves too expensive or impossible to engineer otherwise, bamboo has shown great characteristics (sustainability, durability) that make it a candidate for construction of the lid.

Bill Bremmer offers:
> The most recent lids have been made of high density particle board and that does the trick for keeping them flat and warp free but they weigh SO much that many piano owners cannot lift them. There is little doubt that a bamboo fabricated lid can remain flat and thus resist warping and it would be far lighter, maybe even lighter than traditional wood panel lids.
